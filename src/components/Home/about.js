            Zeitgeist is the annual fest of IIT Ropar. Inviting a footfall of
            over 40000 people from colleges all over North India, one can easily
            get lost in the maze of cultural events Zeitgeist has to offer. Over
            the course of the last few years, Zeitgeist has seen many phenomenal
            performances by outstanding talents including Vishal-Shekhar, Diljit
            Dosanjh, Mohit Chauhan, Zakir Khan. So, We invite you to collaborate
            with us as a Campus Ambassador and spread the word.
