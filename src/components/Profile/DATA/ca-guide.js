        points: [`The most important part of your job is to make students in your
                    college aware of Zeitgeist and ensure maximum participation in
                    the events that will be a part of it. Most of this will be done by
                    sharing the posts from our Facebook page on your timeline and to
                    the other Facebook groups of your college students. The same can
                    also be done through WhatsApp groups, but make sure you've
                    already shared the posts on Facebook.`,
            `Your role is to ensure that maximum people visit our website and
                register (as soon as the registrations begin). This is the task which will
                require your communication skills and convincing abilities but, this
                will be the most important and the most rewarding task. To help you
                out here, we suggest that you focus your attention on the cultural clubs
                and societies of your college, say the Dance club, the Dramatics club,
                the Music club etc. and personally talk and convince the members and
                coordinators of these clubs to register in various events of Zeitgeist.
                Also talk to the old participants as they might be interested and can
                help you get more participants.`,
            `Ensure that the people viewing the posts on our Facebook and
                Instagram page are as many as possible. Like and follow our Facebook
                and Instagram page and convince others to do the same. Also, invite
                people to like our page, this can be easily done by using 'invite all'
                extensions of your internet browser (preferably chrome), you can also
                send the link of our Facebook and Instagram page personally to your
                close friends and make them do the same.`,
            `The events' posters will be released on the Facebook and Instagram page
                of Zeitgeist, which should be shared in different groups on Facebook as well as
                WhatsApp. All these activities have points and the screenshots of the posts
                shared by you will help YOU earn them.`,
            `YOU will be required to print some posters (on an A3 sheet of paper or
                bigger) and paste them at various active and lively areas of your college like
                the cafeteria, mess, notice boards etc. Share pictures of those posters along
                with students on the Facebook page of Zeitgeist and use its screenshot to earn
                points.`,
            `YOU have to take permissions from your Faculties (or DEAN Student
                Affairs) for organizing flash mobs and publicity drives in your colleges.`,
            `Check your Mail and WhatsApp regularly for the updates.`,
            `Deadlines are very important, so make sure you adhere to them else you
                will lose some points.`
